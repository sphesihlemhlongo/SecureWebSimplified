        <h2>What Are SSL/TLS Certificates?</h2>
        <p>
            SSL/TLS certificates are digital documents that authenticate a website's identity and enable encrypted communication between a user's browser and the server.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Components:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issuer:</strong> The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.</li>
            <li><strong>Validity:</strong> The period during which the certificate is valid.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> Used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the server's private key.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Are They Important?</h3>
        <p>
            Certificates ensure that your data cannot be intercepted or altered by attackers, protecting sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
